We will use two data sources:

Faker (for generating fake users and products)
SWAPI API (for fetching Star Wars character data)


Data Structure
Users Table (Generated by Faker)
id, name, email, created_at, updated_at
Products Table (Generated by Faker)
id, name, price, description, created_at, updated_at
StarWarsCharacters Table (Pulled from SWAPI)
id, name, height, mass, birth_year, created_at, updated_at
